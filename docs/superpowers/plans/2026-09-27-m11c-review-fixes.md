# M11c part 1b — Review fixes (performance, then UI/UX)

**Source:** `docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-09-27-emulator-ux-review.md` (emulator
play review, 2026-09-27). **Authority:** the user said "for now always proceed"
(2026-09-27), so the rulings below are Claude's calls, made without a stop. The
user can overrule any of them; each carries its tag in the code.

Verification per task: `tools/run_tests.sh` green, `gdformat --check` and `gdlint`
clean, and the bench where one applies (`godot/bench/bench_draw.gd`, windowed;
`bench_sim.gd`, headless). Numbers are desktop µs.

## Rulings

- **P13 — baked default dots.** Each default-dot look (radius × {normal, hazard,
  chilled}) bakes its six layers into two cached `ImageTexture`s at screen
  resolution: glow + halo (scaled by the pulse) and body + inner + border + pupil.
  That is 2 `draw_texture_rect` per dot instead of 6 draws + 2 transforms. The
  halo's 1.2 px stroke now scales with the pulse (1.02–1.2 px). Frozen dots bake
  into one texture. Baking is C++ (`GradientTexture2D.get_image` +
  `Image.blend_rect`): about 1 ms per look on desktop, once.
- **P14 — the remaining circles.** Coins, orbs, artillery, bullets, carriers,
  satellites, pulsars and specters draw full circles from `CircleSprites`
  (`_ring` falls back to `draw_arc` when a ring texture would blur, the P5 rule).
  Dashed lines and dashed arcs go into one `draw_multiline` each (arcs as 3
  chords per dash). Player-ship circles are unchanged (one ship).

## Tasks

### Task 1: Entity draw (P13, P14)
**Status:** done — `bench_draw`: 115 seekers 911 → 356 µs/frame; late mix (90
seekers, a wall, carriers, artillery, pulsars, specters, aiming chargers; 155
enemies) 2,288 → 920 µs/frame. 665 tests (+3: bake composite order, hollow ring,
dot cache keys and rebakes). A visual comparison at 1:1 matched P5.

### Task 2: Sim cost under load
Profile `bench_sim` with a wall formation on a late swarm (the emulator run had
`s_swarm` 44 ms/frame at 150+). Fix what dominates, bit-exact where the sim is
concerned.

### Task 3: Death-tick hitch
`s_collide` peaked at 36–45 ms (emulator) on the death tick. Measure
`trigger_player_death` parts (bench `test_bench_hits`) and move work off the tick
if it is the save or the goals.

### Task 4: HUD and menu text above entities
Enemies draw over the score, BEST, the shield bar and the menu tagline/title.

### Task 5: Handling preview ship draws black

### Task 6: Close-call popup legibility

### Task 7: Run-over payout explanation ("+0 → 5,531")

### Task 8: Armory purchase feedback and kept scroll position

### Task 9: Truncations, Settings header alignment, small UI items
The rest of the review's UI list, in its order.
